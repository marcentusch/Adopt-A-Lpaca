# Adopt-A-Lpaca
Project to learn new React features and other stuff I was missing:
* Hooks
* Portals
* Effects
* Reach Router
* Proper error handling
* Refs
* Emotion (css in js)
* Code splitting
* React with Typescript
* Server Side Rendering
* Redux
* Proper testing

Styling is material from "Frontend Masters Complete Intro to React v5"


## Development
Install packages with `npm install`
Start project with `npm run dev`

If API is down you can run `npm run dev:mock` to get some mock data to work with
