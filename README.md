# Adopt-A-Lpaca
Project to learn new React features and other stuff I was missing:
* Hooks
* Portals
* Effects
* Reach Router
* Proper error handling
* Refs
* Emotion (css in js)
* Code splitting
* React with Typescript
* Server Side Rendering
* Redux
* Proper testing

Styling is material from "Frontend Masters - Intermediate React v2"

## About technologies
Project uses React and covers most of the main features
Uses Parcel for bundling since it is extremely simple and easy to setup

### Reach Router
Reach Router is used instead of React Router because it has a big accesibility focus so it handles focus well and also has simple API

## Development
Install packages with `npm install`
Start project with `npm run dev`

If API is down you can run `npm run dev:mock` to get some mock data to work with
